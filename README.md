IT WORKS![imagen](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44042957/166131836-065ac6a3-2263-430d-ab32-0391df6731a1.png)

Small weekend project to have a display to show me the latest email I received, along with:
 - Number of unread emails
 - Time and date
 - Temperature (not working yet `:(`)
 - Relative Humidity maybe

This is very needlessly complex as I have to sign into a NextJS website through OAuth and then fetch the data using a Vercel serverless function (God I miss API keys)

TODO: 
- Make a case for it
- Add a button to turn the screen on and off
- idk, it works and i'm happy ðŸŽ‰
